## 1. Problem Domain

### 1.1 Background

[describe the domain in which we are working]

### 1.2 Problem Statement

[describe the problem we intend to solve]

### 1.3 Proposed Solution

[a brief description of the general pattern or approach to solving the problem]

### 1.4 Target Users

| Persona | Description | Primary Use Case |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **[persona 1]** | [describe this persona and their needs] | [describe how this persona would interact with this application to meet their needs]  |
| **[persona 2]** | [describe this persona and their needs] | [describe how this persona would interact with this application to meet their needs]  |

### 1.5 Non-Goals

[[Explicitly state what this project is NOT. Non-goals draw the boundary and prevent scope creep. They are as important as goals — they set expectations for what is out of scope and why.

Each non-goal should state what might reasonably be assumed to be in scope, and explain why it is not.]]

- **Not a [thing].** [Why this is excluded despite seeming related.]
- **Not a [thing].** [Why this is excluded despite seeming related.]

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Technical Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Rationale |
|----|-----------|-----------|
| CT-01 | [define the technical constraint] | [justify why the constraint is rigid] |
| CT-02 | [define the technical constraint] | [justify why the constraint is rigid] |

### 2.2 Product Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Rationale |
|----|-----------|-----------|
| CP-01 | [define the product constraint, usually more market-facing] | [justify why the constraint is rigid] |
| CP-02 | [define the product constraint, usually more market-facing] | [justify why the constraint is rigid] |

## 3. Requirements (EARS Format)

Requirements follow the **EARS** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) notation:

- **Ubiquitous**: The system shall [function].
- **Event-driven**: When [event], the system shall [function].
- **State-driven**: While [state], the system shall [function].
- **Optional**: Where [feature/condition], the system shall [function].
- **Unwanted**: If [unwanted condition], then the system shall [function].

[[Create sections for requirements grouped by theme or topic, as many as are needed. Number requirements sequentially across all groups (R-01, R-02, ...).

TRACEABILITY: Every requirement ID must appear in at least one Test Plan item (Section 6), Acceptance Criteria item (Section 8), or Phase DoD item (Section 8). If a requirement has no corresponding verification item, it is unverified — either add verification or question whether the requirement is real. After implementation, the VRTM (Section 9) provides the formal forward and backward trace.]]

### 3.1 [[Requirement Group A]]

| ID | Type | Requirement |
|----|------|-------------|
| R-01 | [[requirement type]] | [[requirement]] |
| R-02 | [[requirement type]] | [[requirement]] |

### 3.2 [[Requirement Group B]]

| ID | Type | Requirement |
|----|------|-------------|
| R-03 | [[requirement type]] | [[requirement]] |
| R-04 | [[requirement type]] | [[requirement]] |

## 4. Concept of Operations

### 4.1 System Context

[[Diagram showing the system in its environment — what actors interact with it, what external systems it connects to, and where the boundaries are. ASCII art, Mermaid, or a linked image.]]

[[Add sub-sections for each major operational flow. Common flow categories to consider:

- **Primary user flow** — the main happy-path interaction (e.g., "user submits a request → system processes → result delivered")
- **Administrative / maintenance flow** — how operators manage, configure, or maintain the system
- **Integration flow** — how other systems interact with this one (APIs, events, data pipelines)
- **Error / recovery flow** — what happens when things go wrong, how the system recovers
- **Data lifecycle flow** — how data enters, transforms, ages, and is archived or purged

Not every project needs all of these. Include the flows that are necessary to give a reader a high-level understanding of how the system operates in practice.]]

### 4.2 [[Flow Name]]

[[describe the flow step by step]]

---

## 5. Detailed Design

[[Create sub-sections as needed to communicate a full and complete detailed design. Common sub-sections to consider:

- **Data Model / Schema** — core data structures, database schemas, file formats
- **API Surface** — endpoints, tool definitions, CLI interface, function signatures
- **File / Directory Layout** — where things live in the project structure
- **Technology Choices** — table of components with chosen technology and rationale
- **Deployment Architecture** — how the system is deployed and operated (if applicable)
- **Security Model** — authentication, authorization, secrets handling (if applicable)
- **Deliverables Manifest** — everything the project must produce: code artifacts, test outputs, documentation, and verification records (see 5.A below)
- **Installation & Deployment** — how artifacts get from "built" to "running/available" (see 5.B below)

Include diagrams where they add clarity. Prefer ASCII art or Mermaid for version-control-friendly diagrams.]]

_Sections 5.1–5.N are project-specific design topics — add as many as needed. Sections 5.A and 5.B are fixed required sections that always appear last in Section 5._

### 5.1 [[Design Topic]]

[[detailed design content]]

### 5.A Deliverables Manifest

[[The single source of truth for everything this project must produce — code artifacts, test outputs, documentation, and verification records. Every row needs a file path and a wave assignment before the Dev Spec is finalized.

**Tier system:**
- **Tier 1 (required):** Opt-OUT with rationale — must provide "N/A — because [reason]" to skip
- **Tier 2 (conditional):** Added when triggers fire (documented in the trigger column)
- **Tier 3 (opt-in):** Only added when explicitly requested — silent-skip is fine

The table below starts with Tier 1 defaults. The `/devspec create` skill walks these with you during Dev Spec generation. Tier 2 rows are added when their triggers fire. Tier 3 rows are added only on request.]]

| ID | Deliverable | Category | Tier | File Path | Produced In | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|------|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| DM-01 | README.md | Docs | 1 | `README.md` | | required | Project overview, quickstart, contributing guide |
| DM-02 | Unified build system | Code | 1 | `Makefile` | | required | CI and terminal use identical commands |
| DM-03 | CI/CD pipeline | Code | 1 | | | required | Automated lint + test on every PR/MR |
| DM-04 | Automated test suite | Test | 1 | | | required | Unit + integration tests |
| DM-05 | Test results (JUnit XML) | Test | 1 | `reports/junit.xml` | | required | CI artifact upload |
| DM-06 | Coverage report | Test | 1 | `reports/coverage.xml` | | required | CI artifact upload |
| DM-07 | CHANGELOG | Docs | 1 | `CHANGELOG.md` | | required | Release-by-release summary |
| DM-08 | VRTM | Trace | 1 | Dev Spec Appendix V | | required | Requirement traceability matrix |
| DM-09 | Audience-facing doc (ops runbook, user manual, API/CLI ref) | Docs | 1 | | | required | At least one must have a file path |

[[**Tier 2 triggers** (add rows when conditions are met):
- **Manual test procedures** → when MV-XX items exist in Section 6.4
- **Architecture doc** → when >2 interacting components
- **Deployment verification procedures** → when project deploys infrastructure
- **Environment prerequisites doc** → when project has host/platform requirements]]

[[**Tier 3 examples** (add only when requested):
- Sequence diagrams, data flow diagrams, threat model, performance benchmarks]]

### 5.B Installation & Deployment

[[How each artifact gets from "built" to "running/available at its destination." This section directly impacts story acceptance criteria — if a story produces an artifact, the story must include the installation/deployment step.

Define the procedure for each target environment (local dev, CI, staging, production). If the project has a single deployment target, a single procedure is fine.]]

#### Local Installation

[[Step-by-step procedure for installing artifacts locally. This is what developers and agents run after a build.]]

1. [[e.g., `./scripts/ci/build.sh` — produces `dist/my-tool`]]
2. [[e.g., `cp dist/my-tool ~/.local/bin/my-tool` — install to PATH]]
3. [[e.g., `my-tool --version` — verify installation]]

#### CI/CD Pipeline

[[Define the pipeline stages, triggers, and gates. What happens on push, on PR/MR, on merge to main, on tag?

Keep this section focused on the *what* and *when* — which stages run, what triggers them, what artifacts they produce, what gates block promotion. The *how* (specific CI config syntax) belongs in the implementation stories.]]

| Stage | Trigger | Steps | Artifacts Produced | Gate |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------------|------|
| [[e.g., Validate]] | [[e.g., every push]] | [[e.g., lint, typecheck]] | [[e.g., none]] | [[e.g., must pass to merge]] |
| [[e.g., Test]] | [[e.g., every push]] | [[e.g., pytest, coverage]] | [[A-02, A-03]] | [[e.g., must pass to merge]] |
| [[e.g., Build]] | [[e.g., merge to main]] | [[e.g., build.sh]] | [[A-01]] | [[e.g., must succeed]] |
| [[e.g., Publish]] | [[e.g., version tag]] | [[e.g., push to registry]] | [[none (promotes A-01)]] | [[e.g., manual approval]] |

#### Production / Release Deployment

[[If applicable — how the artifact gets deployed to a production or release environment. Omit if the project is a library or local tool with no deployed component.]]

### 5.N Open Questions

[[Capture things you know you don't know yet. Open questions prevent false confidence and flag areas needing research before or during implementation. Each question should describe the decision space and, if possible, the options being considered.

Open questions should be resolved before or during implementation. When resolved, update this section with the decision and rationale, or remove the question and update the relevant design section.]]

## 6. Test Plan

[[This section is written during Dev Spec creation while the agent has full design context. It specifies integration and end-to-end verification — NOT unit tests. Unit tests are specified at story level (Section 8) once the implementation is diced into concrete units.

Every test item is annotated with the requirement IDs it verifies. A single test can verify multiple requirements — use `[R-01, R-03, R-07]` when a test covers several. These annotations feed the VRTM (Section 9, Appendix V).

**Test tier expectations:**
- **Unit tests** (Section 8, story-level Test Procedures): always expected — every story includes them
- **Integration tests** (Section 6.2): expected when the project has component boundaries or module interactions
- **End-to-end tests** (Section 6.3): expected when the project has user-facing flows
- **Manual verification** (Section 6.4): procedures must be both executed AND documented — execution alone without recorded evidence is insufficient]]

### 6.1 Test Strategy

[[Brief overview of the verification approach:
- What is tested automatically vs. manually
- What integration boundaries exist (APIs, databases, external services)
- What environments or fixtures are needed (local, staging, CI, test data)
- Any tooling requirements (test frameworks, browser automation, etc.)]]

### 6.2 Integration Tests (Automated)

[[Tests that verify interactions between components or across module boundaries. Each test specifies the boundary under test, the setup, the action, and the expected outcome.]]

| ID | Boundary | Description | Req IDs |
|----|----------|-------------|---------|
| IT-01 | [[e.g., API → Database]] | [[what the test verifies]] | [[R-XX, R-XX]] |
| IT-02 | [[e.g., CLI → Core lib]] | [[what the test verifies]] | [[R-XX]] |

### 6.3 End-to-End Tests (Automated)

[[Tests that exercise complete user-facing flows from input to output. These validate that the system works as a whole, not just at component boundaries.]]

| ID | Flow | Description | Req IDs |
|----|------|-------------|---------|
| E2E-01 | [[e.g., user submits form → receives confirmation]] | [[what the test verifies]] | [[R-XX, R-XX]] |

### 6.4 Manual Verification Procedures

[[Tests that require human judgment or cannot be automated — UX review, visual inspection, exploratory testing, environment-specific checks. Each procedure has numbered steps and explicit pass/fail criteria.

One of the final stories in the implementation plan (Section 8) must be dedicated to executing these procedures. Manual verification is tracked work, not an afterthought.]]

| ID | Procedure | Pass Criteria | Req IDs |
|----|-----------|--------------|---------|
| MV-01 | [[what to do, step by step]] | [[what "pass" looks like]] | [[R-XX]] |

---

## 7. Definition of Done

[[Section 7 defines the GLOBAL Definition of Done for the project as a whole. Phase-level DoDs live in Section 8 under each Phase header.

The Global DoD is the **project-level acceptance gate**. It references the Test Plan (Section 6) and verifies cross-cutting conditions from Section 3. Annotate each item with the requirement IDs it satisfies — e.g., `[R-01, R-02]`. If a requirement ID does not appear in any DoD, AC, or Test Plan item across the document, it is unverified.

After all phases are complete, the VRTM in Section 9 provides the formal proof that every requirement was verified.]]

- [ ] All Phase DoD checklists are satisfied
- [ ] All Test Plan items (Section 6) executed and passed
- [ ] All deliverables from the Deliverables Manifest (Section 5.A) produced and verified
- [ ] [[cross-cutting condition — annotate with requirement IDs, e.g., [R-01, R-05] ]]
- [ ] [[cross-cutting condition [R-XX] ]]

### 7.2 Dev Spec Finalization Checklist

[[Go/no-go gate before wave planning. Run `/devspec finalize` to verify mechanically.]]

- [ ] Every Tier 1 row in the Deliverables Manifest (5.A) has a file path or "N/A — because [reason]"
- [ ] Every Tier 2 trigger that fires has a corresponding row in the Deliverables Manifest
- [ ] Every Deliverables Manifest row has a "Produced In" wave assignment
- [ ] Every MV-XX in Section 6.4 has a procedure document in the Deliverables Manifest
- [ ] No deliverable is referenced only as a verb without a corresponding noun (file path)
- [ ] At least one audience-facing doc (DM-09) has a file path assigned
- [ ] Section 7 Definition of Done references the Deliverables Manifest (not separate Artifact Manifest + Documentation Kit)

---

## 8. Phased Implementation Plan

### How to read this section

**Phases map to Epics.** Each Phase is a major milestone with its own Definition of Done checklist. When a Phase is complete, its DoD is reviewed and confirmed before the Epic is closed.

**User Stories map to Issues.** Each story becomes a single issue in the project tracker. Stories contain step-by-step implementation instructions ("paint by numbers") and an Acceptance Criteria checklist. Every AC item must be satisfiable and verified before the MR/PR for that story is merged.

**Waves enable parallel development.** Stories are grouped into Waves — sets of stories with no inter-dependencies that can execute simultaneously (e.g., via parallel sub-agents). Each Wave has a Master Issue that orchestrates execution and lists its constituent stories.

**Requirement traceability.** Each AC item is annotated with the requirement ID(s) it verifies — e.g., `[R-01]`. This creates forward traceability from requirements to verification. After implementation, the VRTM in Section 9 captures the complete trace.

**One story, one repo.** If the design spans multiple repositories, every story must be scoped to a single repo. A story is implemented as one PR/MR in one repo — it cannot span repos. When a feature requires coordinated changes across repos, split it into separate stories (one per repo) with explicit dependencies. Each story's header includes a **Repository** field identifying which repo it targets.

### Foundation Story Checklist

Every project needs certain infrastructure before feature work begins. Wave 1 should include a foundation story that covers the items below. Not every project needs all of them — but each should be explicitly included or marked N/A.

- [ ] **Project scaffold** — dependency manifest (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.), package/module structure, empty test directory
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** — implement the pipeline defined in Section 5.B. Automated lint + test on every PR/MR. Keep workflow definitions thin (orchestration only) with logic in scripts.
- [ ] **Artifact build & install** — implement the build commands and installation procedures from the Deliverables Manifest (Section 5.A) and Installation & Deployment (Section 5.B)
- [ ] **Unified build system** — CI and terminal use identical commands (e.g., `make test` in both environments). No CI-only logic that diverges from local dev.
- [ ] **Linting and formatting** — configured and enforced in CI from the first commit
- [ ] **Test runner** — configured and passing (even if the only test is a smoke/import test). Test artifact outputs (JUnit XML, coverage) wired to CI as defined in the Deliverables Manifest (Section 5.A).
- [ ] **Makefile or task runner** — standard targets (`lint`, `test`, `ci`) so humans and agents use the same commands
- [ ] **Initial documentation** — README and any Phase 1 items from the Deliverables Manifest (Section 5.A)
- [ ] **Verify Deliverables Manifest coverage** — all rows in the Deliverables Manifest (Section 5.A) assigned to Wave 1 are covered by this story

If any of these are missing from Wave 1, add a story. CI/CD in particular is easy to forget and painful to retrofit — every PR from Wave 2 onward should be validated automatically.

### Closing Story Checklist

The final wave must include a story that executes all manual verification procedures from the Test Plan (Section 6.4). This story:

- [ ] Executes each MV-XX procedure and records pass/fail with evidence
- [ ] Creates bug issues for any failures found during manual verification
- [ ] Completes the VRTM (Section 9, Appendix V) with final status for all items
- [ ] Verifies all Deliverables Manifest rows with "Produced In" matching this phase have been delivered
- [ ] Verifies every delivered artifact has its verification procedure executed and recorded

Do not skip this story. Manual verification is tracked work with its own acceptance criteria, not a "someone will get to it" afterthought.

### Wave Map

[[Create an ASCII diagram showing the wave dependency flow. Each wave lists its stories. Arrows show which waves must complete before the next can start.]]

```
Wave 1 ─── [X.X] Story name (foundation)
              │
Wave 2 ─┬─ [X.X] Story A
         ├─ [X.X] Story B
         └─ [X.X] Story C
              │
Wave 3 ─── [X.X] Story D
```

[[Create a summary table of waves]]

| Wave | Stories | Master Issue | Parallel? |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | X.X | Story X.X | Single story |
| 2 | X.X, X.X, X.X | Wave 2 Master | Yes — N independent stories |
| 3 | X.X | Story X.X | Single story |

### Co-production Rule

If a wave produces a deployable artifact (binary, Docker image, infrastructure config, API endpoint), that wave must also include a story that produces the artifact's verification procedure. Verification procedures must not be deferred to later waves. This ensures that every artifact can be validated at the time it lands.

---

### Phase N: [[Phase Name]] (Epic)

**Goal:** [[one-sentence description of what this phase proves or delivers]]

#### Phase N Definition of Done

[[A checklist of conditions that must ALL be true before this Phase/Epic is closed. These are confirmed as a checkpoint before moving to the next Phase. Items should be concrete and verifiable — not "it works" but "command X produces output Y".

Annotate each item with the requirement IDs it verifies. The Phase DoD gates the phase; the Test Plan (Section 6) provides the verification strategy.]]

- [ ] [[verifiable condition [R-XX] ]]
- [ ] [[verifiable condition [R-XX, R-XX] ]]
- [ ] All Phase N unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration/E2E tests applicable to Phase N pass

---

#### Story N.N: [[Story Title]]

**Wave:** [[wave number]]
**Repository:** [[repo name — e.g., `myorg/backend`. Omit if the project is a single repo.]]
**Dependencies:** [[list of story IDs that must complete first, or "None"]]

[[1-2 sentence description of what this story delivers and why]]

**Implementation Steps:**

[[Step-by-step instructions for implementing this story. Be specific enough that another developer (human or AI) could follow these instructions without guessing. Include:
- Exact file paths to create or modify
- Function signatures and key logic
- Data structures and schemas
- How to wire components together

Test specifications go in the Test Procedures section below — not here.

Think "paint by numbers" — each step should be unambiguous. If a step requires judgment or exploration, say so explicitly rather than leaving it implicit.]]

1. [[specific implementation step]]
2. [[specific implementation step]]
3. [[specific implementation step]]

**Test Procedures:**

[[Same granularity as implementation steps. Specifies the unit tests that verify this story's work, plus references to integration or E2E tests from the Test Plan (Section 6) that become runnable after this story.

Unit tests are specified HERE — not in the Test Plan — because the concrete units only become known when the story is diced from the design. Each unit test entry documents the test's name, purpose, and location in the source tree.]]

*Unit Tests:*

| Test Name | Purpose | File Location |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `[[test_function_name]]` | [[what it verifies]] | `[[tests/test_module.py]]` |

*Integration/E2E Coverage:*

[[Which tests from the Test Plan (Section 6) become runnable or are advanced by this story:]]
- [[IT-XX — now runnable (this story implements the relevant boundary)]]
- [[E2E-XX — partially runnable (needs Story N.N for completion)]]

**Acceptance Criteria:**

[[A checklist of conditions that must ALL be verified before the MR/PR for this story is merged. Each item should be:
- Testable: can be verified by running a command, reading output, or inspecting code
- Specific: names exact functions, files, commands, or behaviors
- Complete: covers all functionality introduced by this story
- Traced: annotated with the requirement ID(s) it verifies — e.g., [R-01]

Do NOT include vague items like "code works" or "implementation is correct". Every item should be something a reviewer can check off by performing a concrete action.]]

- [ ] [[testable condition [R-XX] — e.g., "schema.yaml exists and is valid JSON Schema"]]
- [ ] [[testable condition [R-XX] — e.g., "schema.py rejects invalid archetype enum"]]
- [ ] [[testable condition [R-XX] — e.g., "all tests in test_schema.py pass"]]

## 9. Appendices

[[Use appendices for detailed reference material that supports the main document but would interrupt its flow. Common appendices:

- **Full examples** — complete annotated examples of data formats, API requests/responses, configuration files
- **Glossary** — domain-specific terms used throughout the document
- **Research notes** — background research, benchmarks, or comparisons that informed design decisions
- **Migration plans** — if replacing an existing system, how data or users transition]]

### Appendix A: [[Title]]

[[detailed reference content]]

### Appendix V: Verification Requirements Traceability Matrix (VRTM)

[[This appendix is populated AFTER implementation is complete. It provides formal proof that every requirement in Section 3 was implemented and verified.

The VRTM is generated by collecting all requirement ID annotations from:
- **Test Plan items** (Section 6) — integration tests (IT-XX), E2E tests (E2E-XX), manual procedures (MV-XX)
- **Phase DoD items** (Section 8) — phase-level acceptance gates
- **Story AC items** (Section 8) — story-level acceptance criteria

Any requirement ID that does not appear in this matrix represents a gap — either the requirement was not implemented, or the verification was not documented.

Complete this matrix as each Phase is closed. By the time all Phases are done, every row should have a Status.]]

| Req ID | Requirement (short) | Source | Verification Item | Verification Method | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| R-01 | [[brief description]] | [[Story N.N / Test Plan / Phase DoD]] | [[AC item, test ID (IT-XX, E2E-XX, MV-XX), or DoD item]] | [[unit test / integration test / e2e test / manual / inspection]] | [[Pass / Fail / Pending]] |
| R-02 | [[brief description]] | [[Story N.N / Test Plan / Phase DoD]] | [[AC item, test ID (IT-XX, E2E-XX, MV-XX), or DoD item]] | [[unit test / integration test / e2e test / manual / inspection]] | [[Pass / Fail / Pending]] |

[[If a requirement is verified by multiple items across different stories or the Test Plan, include one row per verification (a requirement may have multiple rows). This captures defense-in-depth verification.]]
